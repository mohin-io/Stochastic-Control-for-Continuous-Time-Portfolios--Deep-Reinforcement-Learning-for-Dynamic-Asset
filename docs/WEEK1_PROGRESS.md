|--------|----|----|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Bull** | 0 | 1,413 | 55.0% | 0.000864 | 0.009236 |
| **Bear** | 1 | 199 | 7.7% | -0.000658 | 0.042954 |
| **Volatile** | 2 | 958 | 37.3% | 0.000796 | 0.018704 |

**Key Insights:**
- Bull market dominates (55% of observations)
- Bear markets are rare but severe (high volatility)
- Volatile regime captures high uncertainty periods

#### Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
**Model:** `models/hmm_regime_detector.pkl`

**Regime Classification:**
| Regime | ID | Count | Percentage | Avg Return | Avg Volatility | Avg Duration |
|--------|----|----|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Volatile** | 0 | 1,184 | 46.1% | 0.000334 | 0.012050 | 10.5 days |
| **Bull** | 1 | 1,181 | 46.0% | 0.001645 | 0.017167 | 21.9 days |
| **Bear** | 2 | 205 | 8.0% | -0.002364 | 0.037113 | 2.7 days |

**Transition Matrix:**
```
          Volatile   Bull   Bear
Volatile     0.856  0.071  0.073

- Bull markets very stable (91.6% self-transition)
- Bear markets short-lived (2.7 day average)
- Bear → Volatile transition most common (35.1%)

**Regime Agreement:** GMM vs HMM agree 36.3% of the time (different methodologies capture different aspects)

**Files Created:**
- `models/gmm_regime_detector.pkl`
- `models/hmm_regime_detector.pkl`
- `data/regime_labels/gmm_regimes.csv`

## 💡 Insights & Observations

### Data Quality
- VIX data has fewer observations than asset prices (different trading hours)
- Data alignment reduces dataset from 4,943 to 3,774 days
- Further reduction to 2,570 days after volatility calculation (20-day rolling window)
- Final dataset spans 2014-2024 (10 years) - excellent for training

### Regime Detection
- GMM and HMM capture different aspects of market regimes
- Low agreement (36.3%) suggests complementary information
- Bull regime persistence (21.9 days) much longer than bear (2.7 days)
- High self-transition probabilities indicate regime stability

### Training Considerations
- Each DQN episode takes ~6-7 seconds on CPU
- 1000 episodes = ~1.7-2 hours estimated
- State dimension of 34 is reasonable for Q-Network
- Exploration-exploitation balance important (ε decay working)
