## Executive Summary

This document provides a **thorough gap analysis** between the comprehensive 25-day implementation plan ([PLAN.md](PLAN.md)) and the current state of the codebase. The analysis reveals that **most critical infrastructure** has been implemented, but several **key components remain incomplete** to achieve the full vision outlined in the plan.

### Overall Progress: **~78% Complete** ✨ (Updated Oct 4, 2025)

✅ **Completed:** Data pipeline, regime detection, RL environment, advanced agents (DQN, PPO, SAC), visualization, dashboards, API, Docker, testing, optimizations, **ALL BASELINE STRATEGIES** ✨
⚠️ **Partial:** Backtesting framework (metrics but no engine)
❌ **Missing:** Jupyter notebooks, full backtesting engine, crisis analysis, full training runs, performance comparison reports
