# Automated Sequential Training - Setup Complete ✅

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **READY TO USE**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Automated scripts have been created to train all three RL agents (DQN, PPO, SAC) sequentially without manual intervention.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Current Status**

**DQN is already training!** ✅
- Started manually
- Currently at episode 58/1000 (~6% complete)
- Expected completion: ~3 hours from start
- Log: `logs/dqn_training.log`

### **Option 1: Continue Current Training** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

Let the current DQN training finish, then manually start PPO and SAC:

**After DQN completes (~3 hours):**
```bash
python scripts/train_ppo_optimized.py --n-envs 8 --total-timesteps 500000 --output-dir models/ppo
```

**After PPO completes (~4-6 hours):**
```bash
python scripts/train_sac.py --total-timesteps 500000 --save models/sac_trained.pth
```

---

### **Option 2: Use Automated Script (Next Time)**

For future training runs, use the automated sequential script:

**Windows:**
```batch
scripts\train_all_sequential.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/train_all_sequential.sh
./scripts/train_all_sequential.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Trains all three agents automatically
- ✅ Saves logs to `logs/` directory
- ✅ Checks for errors between steps
- ✅ Shows progress and completion status
- ✅ Total runtime: ~12-14 hours

---

## 📊 Monitoring Progress

### Check Training Status
```bash
python scripts/monitor_training.py
```

### Watch Live Logs
```bash
# DQN
tail -f logs/dqn_training.log

# PPO (when starts)
tail -f logs/ppo_training.log

# SAC (when starts)
tail -f logs/sac_training.log
```

### Check Process Status
```bash
# Windows
tasklist | findstr python

# Linux/Mac
ps aux | grep python
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

| Time | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 14:31 UTC | DQN started | ✅ Running |
| ~17:31 UTC | DQN completes | ⏳ Pending |
| ~17:31 UTC | PPO starts (manual or auto) | ⏳ Pending |
| ~21:31-23:31 UTC | PPO completes | ⏳ Pending |
| ~21:31-23:31 UTC | SAC starts (manual or auto) | ⏳ Pending |
| ~00:31-04:31 UTC | **ALL COMPLETE** ✅ | ⏳ Pending |

**Total Duration:** ~12-14 hours

## 🎯 What Happens Automatically

### Sequential Script Features

1. **Creates directories**
   - `logs/` for training logs
   - `models/` for saved models

2. **Trains DQN**
   - 1000 episodes
   - Saves to `models/dqn_trained.pth`
   - Logs to `logs/dqn_training.log`

3. **Trains PPO** (after DQN succeeds)
   - 500K timesteps with 8 parallel environments
   - Saves to `models/ppo/ppo_final.pth`
   - Logs to `logs/ppo_training.log`

4. **Trains SAC** (after PPO succeeds)
   - 500K timesteps
   - Saves to `models/sac_trained.pth`
   - Logs to `logs/sac_training.log`

5. **Error Handling**
   - Stops if any training fails
   - Shows clear error messages
   - Logs remain available for debugging

---

## ✅ After Training Completes

### Verify Models
```bash
python scripts/monitor_training.py
```

Expected output:
```
DQN      : ✅ Complete (1.23 MB)
PPO      : ✅ Complete (2.45 MB)
SAC      : ✅ Complete (1.87 MB)
```

### Next Steps
1. **Create RL Agent Adapters** (2-3 hours)
   - Integrate trained models with BacktestEngine
   - Create strategy adapters for DQN/PPO/SAC

2. **Run Comprehensive Backtests** (1-2 hours)
   - Compare RL agents vs 5 baseline strategies
   - Generate performance metrics
   - Create visualizations

3. **Generate Final Reports** (1 hour)
   - Training summaries
   - Performance comparisons
   - Conclusions and insights

## 📋 File Reference

### Created Scripts
- `scripts/train_all_sequential.sh` - Linux/Mac automated training
- `scripts/train_all_sequential.bat` - Windows automated training
- `scripts/monitor_training.py` - Training progress monitor

### Existing Scripts (Used by Sequential)
- `scripts/train_dqn.py` - DQN training
- `scripts/train_ppo_optimized.py` - PPO training
- `scripts/train_sac.py` - SAC training

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Training Stops
1. Check error in log file
2. Fix the issue
3. Resume from that step manually

### If Out of Memory
- Reduce `--n-envs` for PPO (e.g., from 8 to 4)
- Reduce `batch_size` in agent code
- Close other applications

### If Need to Restart
Scripts save checkpoints - you can manually restart from last checkpoint.

---

## 💡 Tips

### For Overnight Training
- Don't put computer to sleep
- Disable auto-sleep in power settings
- Ensure adequate cooling
- Close unnecessary applications

### For Monitoring
```bash
# Check every hour
python scripts/monitor_training.py

# Or watch logs continuously
tail -f logs/*.log
```

### For Best Results
- Use GPU if available (`--device cuda`)
- Close memory-intensive applications
- Ensure stable power supply
- Keep system cool

---

## 🎊 You're All Set!

**Current State:**
- ✅ DQN training in progress (6% complete)
- ✅ Automated scripts ready for PPO and SAC
- ✅ Monitoring tools available
- ✅ All infrastructure in place

**Action Required:**
- ⏳ Wait for DQN to complete (~3 hours)
- ⏳ Manually start PPO OR use automated script
- ⏳ Let everything run overnight

**Project completion after training:**  **95%+** 🚀
