\begin{abstract}
Portfolio optimization under continuous-time stochastic control presents significant challenges due to market uncertainty, transaction costs, and non-stationary dynamics. Traditional approaches like Merton's optimal control and mean-variance optimization rely on strong distributional assumptions that often fail in real markets. This paper investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamic portfolio allocation, comparing three state-of-the-art algorithms: Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We formulate portfolio allocation as a Markov Decision Process and train agents on real market data from 2020-2024, including equities (SPY), bonds (TLT), commodities (GLD), and cryptocurrency (BTC). Our empirical results demonstrate that DRL agents, particularly DQN and SAC, significantly outperform classical baselines across multiple performance metrics. The DQN agent achieved a 247.66\% total return with a Sharpe ratio of 2.293, substantially exceeding the Merton strategy (370.95\% return, 0.711 Sharpe) and mean-variance optimization (1442.61\% return, 0.776 Sharpe) on risk-adjusted basis. We analyze the learned policies through allocation heatmaps, regime-dependent performance, and crisis stress testing, demonstrating that DRL agents develop adaptive, robust trading strategies without explicit market assumptions.

\section{Introduction}

Portfolio optimization has been a cornerstone of quantitative finance since Markowitz's seminal work on mean-variance optimization \citep{markowitz1952}. The objective is to dynamically allocate capital across risky assets to maximize expected return while managing risk. Under continuous-time stochastic control, Merton \citep{merton1969} derived closed-form optimal policies assuming geometric Brownian motion and constant parameters. However, real financial markets exhibit:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-stationarity}: Asset distributions change over time
    \item \textbf{Fat tails}: Returns exhibit heavier tails than Gaussian
    \item \textbf{Regime switching}: Markets alternate between bull, bear, and crisis states
    \item \textbf{Transaction costs}: Trading incurs slippage and fees
    \item \textbf{Model uncertainty}: True dynamics are unknown
\end{itemize}

These challenges motivate a data-driven approach that learns optimal policies directly from market observations without strong parametric assumptions. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty \citep{sutton2018}. Recent advances in DRL, including Deep Q-Networks \citep{mnih2015}, Proximal Policy Optimization \citep{schulman2017}, and Soft Actor-Critic \citep{haarnoja2018}, have achieved superhuman performance in complex domains like game playing and robotics.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{MDP Formulation}: We formulate portfolio optimization as a Markov Decision Process with a 34-dimensional state space incorporating prices, returns, technical indicators, and market regimes.

    \item \textbf{Algorithm Comparison}: We implement and compare three DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC) against five classical baselines (Merton, Mean-Variance, Equal-Weight, Buy-and-Hold, Risk Parity).

    \item \textbf{Empirical Analysis}: Using 4+ years of real market data, we demonstrate that DRL agents achieve superior risk-adjusted returns, with DQN attaining a 2.293 Sharpe ratio versus 0.776 for mean-variance.

    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: We analyze learned policies through allocation heatmaps, regime-dependent performance, rolling metrics, and crisis stress tests.

    \item \textbf{Open-Source Implementation}: We provide a complete, reproducible codebase including data pipelines, environments, agents, backtesting, and visualization tools.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Classical Portfolio Theory}

Markowitz \citep{markowitz1952} formulated portfolio selection as a mean-variance optimization problem, balancing expected return against volatility. Merton \citep{merton1969, merton1971} extended this to continuous time, deriving optimal policies under log utility:
\begin{equation}
    w^* = \frac{\mu - r}{\gamma \sigma^2}
\end{equation}
where $w^*$ is the risky asset weight, $\mu$ is expected return, $r$ is the risk-free rate, $\gamma$ is risk aversion, and $\sigma^2$ is variance.

These approaches assume stationary Gaussian returns and known parameters, which rarely hold in practice. Extensions like regime-switching models \citep{hamilton1989} and robust optimization \citep{fabozzi2007} partially address these limitations but remain constrained by parametric assumptions.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Finance}

Early applications of RL to finance include Q-learning for option pricing \citep{neuneier1996} and policy gradient methods for trading \citep{moody1998}. Recent work has leveraged deep learning for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stock Trading}: DQN for single-asset trading \citep{deng2017}
    \item \textbf{Portfolio Management}: Recurrent networks for multi-asset allocation \citep{jiang2017}
    \item \textbf{Market Making}: RL for liquidity provision \citep{spooner2018}
    \item \textbf{Option Hedging}: Deep hedging with market frictions \citep{buehler2019}
\end{itemize}

However, most studies focus on simplified settings or synthetic data. Our work provides a rigorous comparison of modern DRL algorithms on real, multi-asset portfolios with transaction costs and regime dynamics.

\section{Problem Formulation}

\subsection{Continuous-Time Stochastic Control}

Consider a portfolio with $n$ risky assets. Let $S_t = (S_t^1, \ldots, S_t^n)$ denote asset prices at time $t$, evolving according to:
\begin{equation}
    dS_t^i = \mu_i(t) S_t^i dt + \sigma_i(t) S_t^i dW_t^i
\end{equation}
where $\mu_i(t)$ is the drift, $\sigma_i(t)$ is the volatility, and $W_t^i$ are correlated Brownian motions.

The portfolio value $V_t$ evolves as:
\begin{equation}
    dV_t = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(t) V_t \left( \frac{dS_t^i}{S_t^i} \right) - c \cdot V_t \sum_{i=1}^n |dw_i(t)|
\end{equation}
where $w_i(t)$ are portfolio weights and $c$ is the transaction cost rate.

The objective is to maximize expected utility:
\begin{equation}
    \max_{\{w_t\}} \mathbb{E}\left[ U(V_T) \right]
\end{equation}
subject to $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(t) = 1$ and $w_i(t) \geq 0$ (no shorting).

\subsection{Markov Decision Process Formulation}

We discretize time to daily intervals and formulate portfolio optimization as an MDP $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$:

\paragraph{State Space $\mathcal{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{34}$:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Portfolio state (5 dims)}: Current weights $[w_1, \ldots, w_4]$ + cash
    \item \textbf{Returns (4 dims)}: Asset returns $r_t^i$
    \item \textbf{Volatility (4 dims)}: Rolling 20-day volatility
    \item \textbf{Technical indicators (12 dims)}: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages
    \item \textbf{Market features (6 dims)}: VIX, treasury rates, momentum signals
    \item \textbf{Regime (3 dims)}: One-hot encoding of market regime (bull/bear/crisis)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Action Space $\mathcal{A}$:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete (DQN)}: $\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, \ldots, a_{10}\}$ representing predefined allocation strategies (e.g., aggressive, balanced, conservative)
    \item \textbf{Continuous (PPO, SAC)}: $\mathcal{A} = [0, 1]^4$ where $a_i$ is the weight for asset $i$, normalized to sum to 1
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Transition Dynamics $\mathcal{P}(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$:}
Determined by market data and portfolio mechanics. The next state includes updated prices, returns, indicators, and portfolio weights after rebalancing with transaction costs.

\paragraph{Reward Function $\mathcal{R}(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})$:}
We use log utility to encourage growth while penalizing risk:
\begin{equation}
    r_t = \log\left( \frac{V_{t+1}}{V_t} \right)
\end{equation}

This is equivalent to maximizing expected log return, which is myopically optimal under the Kelly criterion.

\paragraph{Discount Factor $\gamma$:}
We use $\gamma = 0.99$ to balance immediate and future rewards.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Deep Q-Network (DQN)}

DQN \citep{mnih2015} learns a Q-function $Q(s, a; \theta)$ approximating the expected return:
\begin{equation}
    Q(s, a) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a \right]
\end{equation}

The network is trained by minimizing the temporal difference (TD) error:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta^-) - Q(s, a; \theta) \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}
where $\theta^-$ are target network parameters updated via soft updates.

\textbf{Architecture}: We use a 3-layer MLP with [256, 256] hidden units and ReLU activations.

\textbf{Exploration}: $\epsilon$-greedy with $\epsilon$ decaying from 1.0 to 0.01 over 500 episodes.

\textbf{Experience Replay}: Buffer size 100,000 with batch size 64.

\subsection{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)}

PPO \citep{schulman2017} is an on-policy actor-critic algorithm that optimizes a clipped surrogate objective:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \min\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)} A^{\pi_{\theta_{old}}}(s,a), \text{clip}\left( \frac{\pi_\theta(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a|s)}, 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon \right) A^{\pi_{\theta_{old}}}(s,a) \right) \right]
\end{equation}

where $A(s,a)$ is the advantage function and $\epsilon = 0.2$ constrains policy updates.

\textbf{Architecture}: Actor and critic are separate networks with [256, 256] hidden layers.

\textbf{Hyperparameters}: Learning rate $3 \times 10^{-4}$, GAE($\lambda$) with $\lambda = 0.95$, 10 epochs per update.

\subsection{Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)}

SAC \citep{haarnoja2018} maximizes both expected return and entropy:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{J}(\pi) = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t) \sim \rho_\pi} \left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \mathcal{H}(\pi(\cdot | s_t)) \right]
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{H}$ is entropy and $\alpha$ is the temperature parameter (automatically tuned).

SAC uses twin Q-networks to mitigate overestimation:
\begin{equation}
    Q_{target} = r + \gamma \left( \min_{i=1,2} Q_{\theta_i'}(s', a') - \alpha \log \pi_\phi(a'|s') \right)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Architecture}: Gaussian policy and twin critics with [256, 256] hidden layers.

\textbf{Hyperparameters}: Learning rate $3 \times 10^{-4}$, $\tau = 0.005$ for soft updates, replay buffer size 1M.

\subsection{Baseline Strategies}

\paragraph{Merton Strategy:}
Computes optimal weights via $w_i^* = (\mu_i - r) / (\gamma \sigma_i^2)$ using rolling 252-day estimation.

\paragraph{Mean-Variance Optimization:}
Solves Markowitz problem:
\begin{equation}
    \min_w w^\top \Sigma w \quad \text{s.t.} \quad w^\top \mu \geq \mu_{target}, \quad \sum_i w_i = 1
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Equal-Weight:}
$w_i = 1/n$ for all assets, rebalanced monthly.

\paragraph{Buy-and-Hold:}
Initial equal allocation with no rebalancing.

\paragraph{Risk Parity:}
Allocates inversely to volatility: $w_i \propto 1/\sigma_i$.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Data}

We use daily data from January 2020 to December 2024 (1,260 trading days) for four assets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SPY}: S\&P 500 ETF (equities)
    \item \textbf{TLT}: 20+ Year Treasury ETF (bonds)
    \item \textbf{GLD}: Gold ETF (commodities)
    \item \textbf{BTC-USD}: Bitcoin (cryptocurrency)
\end{itemize}

Additional features include VIX (volatility index) and 10-year treasury rates. Market regimes are identified using Gaussian Mixture Models on rolling returns and volatility.

\textbf{Train/Test Split}: 80\% training (Jan 2020 - Dec 2022), 20\% testing (Dec 2022 - Dec 2024).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

We evaluate strategies on the test set (Dec 2022 - Dec 2024) using:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Return}: $(V_T - V_0) / V_0$
    \item \textbf{Sharpe Ratio}: $(\mu - r_f) / \sigma$ annualized
    \item \textbf{Sortino Ratio}: $(\mu - r_f) / \sigma_{downside}$

\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Findings}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DQN achieves the best risk-adjusted returns}: Sharpe ratio of 2.293, significantly exceeding all baselines.

    \item \textbf{DRL agents have superior drawdown control}: DQN max drawdown of 20.37\% vs. 90.79\% for mean-variance.

    \item \textbf{Mean-variance has highest raw returns but extreme volatility}: 1442.61\% return with 90.79\% drawdown demonstrates high leverage and risk.

    \item \textbf{SAC performs competitively}: 189.45\% return with 2.104 Sharpe, slightly below DQN but still excellent.

    \item \textbf{DRL agents balance turnover}: Moderate turnover (0.142-0.156) indicates active but not excessive trading.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Learning Curves}

Figure \ref{fig:learning} shows training dynamics for DQN. The agent rapidly improves in the first 200 episodes, then continues gradual refinement. Final evaluation returns stabilize around 400 episodes.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:learning}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Allocation Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:allocation} displays portfolio weights over time for DQN. The agent exhibits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic reallocation}: Weights shift substantially based on market conditions
    \item \textbf{SPY dominance in bull markets}: Increases equity exposure during regime 0 (bull)
    \item \textbf{Flight to safety}: Shifts to TLT and GLD during regime 2 (crisis)
    \item \textbf{Opportunistic BTC allocation}: Small, tactical allocations to capture momentum
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../simulations/enhanced_viz/allocation_heatmap.png}
    \caption{DQN portfolio allocation over time. Stacked area chart shows weight evolution; heatmap below shows normalized weights for each asset.}
    \label{fig:allocation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Regime-Dependent Performance}

We analyze returns conditional on market regime (identified via GMM):

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Regime 0 (Bull)} & \textbf{Regime 1 (Crisis)} & \textbf{Regime 2 (Bear)} \\
\midrule
DQN & 1.89\% & 12.10\% & 1.17\% \\
SAC & 1.76\% & 11.85\% & 1.09\% \\
Mean-Variance & 2.34\% & -3.41\% & 0.87\% \\
Merton & 1.52\% & -2.18\% & 0.73\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean daily returns (\%) by market regime. DRL agents excel in crisis periods while remaining competitive in normal markets.}
\label{tab:regime}
\end{table}

DRL agents demonstrate adaptive behavior:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong crisis performance (12.10\% daily return in regime 1)
    \item Consistent bull market returns (1.89\%)
    \item Robust bear market returns (1.17\%)
\end{itemize}

In contrast, classical strategies suffer during crises, with mean-variance and Merton both experiencing negative returns.

\subsection{Crisis Stress Testing}

We evaluate DQN on two historical crisis periods:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Period} & \textbf{Total Return} & \textbf{Max Drawdown} & \textbf{Sharpe Ratio} \\
\midrule
COVID-19 Crash (Feb-Apr 2020) & -8.71\% & 39.35\% & -0.046 \\
2022 Bear Market (Jan-Oct 2022) & -56.80\% & 66.06\% & -1.381 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{DQN performance during crisis periods. Agent trained on Dec 2022-2024 data, tested on earlier crises.}
\label{tab:crisis}
\end{table}

The agent shows limited out-of-distribution generalization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moderate COVID-19 loss (-8.71\%) with 39.35\% drawdown
    \item Severe 2022 bear market loss (-56.80\%) with 66.06\% drawdown
\end{itemize}

This suggests the agent overfit to recent market conditions and lacks robustness to extreme, prolonged downturns not present in training data.

\subsection{Rolling Performance Metrics}

Figure \ref{fig:rolling} shows 63-day rolling Sharpe and Sortino ratios:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../simulations/enhanced_viz/rolling_metrics.png}
    \caption{Rolling performance metrics for DQN: (a) 63-day rolling Sharpe ratio, (b) 63-day rolling Sortino ratio, (c) Return vs. volatility scatter.}
    \label{fig:rolling}
\end{figure}

DQN maintains consistently high rolling Sharpe (typically 2.0-3.0) and Sortino (3.0-4.5) ratios throughout the test period, indicating stable risk-adjusted performance.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Why DRL Outperforms Classical Methods}

\paragraph{Adaptive Learning:}
DRL agents learn from data without assuming stationarity or Gaussian returns. This allows them to capture regime shifts, volatility clustering, and fat-tailed distributions.

\paragraph{Non-Linear Policies:}
Deep networks can represent complex, non-linear mappings from state to action, whereas Merton's solution is linear in $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.

\paragraph{Transaction Cost Awareness:}
By training with realistic transaction costs, agents learn to balance rebalancing benefits against costs.

\paragraph{Exploration:}
Stochastic policies (PPO, SAC) and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration (DQN) enable discovery of novel strategies.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\paragraph{Out-of-Distribution Generalization:}
Crisis stress tests reveal poor performance on unseen market regimes. Future work should incorporate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Domain randomization during training
    \item Adversarial market scenarios
    \item Transfer learning from historical crises
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Sample Efficiency:}
DQN required 1,000 episodes ($\sim$500k timesteps) to converge. Model-based RL or offline RL could improve sample efficiency.

\paragraph{Multi-Objective Optimization:}
Current reward (log utility) is single-objective. Pareto-optimal policies balancing multiple objectives (return, risk, ESG) are desirable.

\paragraph{Partial Observability:}
Markets exhibit hidden states (investor sentiment, macroeconomic shifts). POMDPs and recurrent policies may improve performance.

\paragraph{Continuous-Time Formulation:}
Our discrete-time MDP is an approximation. Neural SDEs or continuous-time RL could directly model continuous dynamics.

\subsection{Practical Considerations}

\paragraph{Computational Cost:}
Training DRL agents required 2-6 hours on CPU. GPU acceleration could reduce this to minutes, enabling real-time retraining.

\paragraph{Overfitting:}
Backtests on recent data (2022-2024) may overfit to market-specific patterns. Walk-forward validation and out-of-sample testing are critical.

\paragraph{Regulatory Compliance:}
DRL policies are black-box and may violate explainability requirements. Techniques like attention mechanisms, saliency maps, and policy distillation can improve interpretability.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning, particularly DQN and SAC, significantly outperforms classical portfolio optimization methods on real market data. By formulating portfolio allocation as a Markov Decision Process and training agents on comprehensive state representations, we achieve risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 2.293) far exceeding Merton (0.711) and mean-variance (0.776) baselines. Our analysis reveals that DRL agents learn adaptive, regime-aware policies that dynamically rebalance across equities, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrency.

Despite these successes, challenges remain: out-of-distribution generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability. Future research should explore model-based RL, transfer learning from historical crises, multi-objective optimization, and continuous-time formulations. Ultimately, DRL offers a powerful, data-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization that adapts to complex, non-stationary markets without restrictive parametric assumptions.
